# APWb-WAIM-APES
This repository provides the implementation of APES, an interactive spatial pattern mining framework that integrates user feedback to guide the discovery of high-utility patterns. APES combines probabilistic modeling, sampling, and visualization to adaptively focus on patterns that satisfy both predefined constraints and user interests.
